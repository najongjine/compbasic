## Sources
- Layoffs.fyi: historical CSV (4,000+ events 2020-present) + Playwright live scrape on every run
- FRED API: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -- 6 US labor series (free key required)
- World Bank API: api.worldbank.org -- global labor indicators, no API key required
- NewsAPI: newsapi.org -- global headlines, last 30 days per run; seed covers 2022-present

## Live Scraper Notes
layoffs.fyi is a JS-rendered React/Next.js site. The scraper uses Playwright (headless
Chromium) as its primary strategy -- it intercepts the Airtable API XHR calls the
React app fires on page load, giving us raw JSON before any rendering. Four strategies:

1. Playwright + Airtable/API intercept: captures exact JSON the React table uses
2. Playwright + rendered HTML: parses __NEXT_DATA__ or HTML table after full JS execution
3. requests + __NEXT_DATA__: fast, works on SSR/CDN-cached server responses
4. requests + HTML/inline scripts: last-resort pattern matching

If all strategies fail the notebook falls back to the historical CSV -- no data is lost.
